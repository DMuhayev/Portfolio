Here you can see my realization of interesting task - control of 2d drone (copter).

2d drone, or bicopter as I call it, is an easier model of a real quadrocopter.

Task was: build a model [bicopter.slx], using knowledge of control engineering stabilize bicopter's rotation angle [angle_stab.slx], angle + altitude [anglehigh_stab.slx], stabilize bicopter position [pos_control.slx] and finally make bicopter overfly a circle [almost_round.slx].

Control methods used - deep feedback + PID control. Some of PID's constants were found experimantally.
