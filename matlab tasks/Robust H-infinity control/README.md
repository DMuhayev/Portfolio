Here are task to implement a system control by algorithm given in this book {book.pdf} (if you can read russian).

Brief description - solve given linear matrix inequality (LMI) system with additional requirement to matrices (some of them must be invertible).

![Inf image](https://github.com/DMuhayev/Portfolio/blob/master/matlab%20tasks/Robust%20H-infinity%20control/image.png?raw=true)

To do this I needed to use iterative method and solve a heap of LMI systems.
