Here are task to implement a system control by algorithm given in this book {} (if you can read russian).

Brief description - solve given linear matrix inequality (LMI) system with additional requirement to matrices (some of them must be invertible).

To do this I needed to use iterative method and solve a heap of LMI systems.
