# README

Hello everyone!

My name is Damir Mukhayev, I'm going to finish my study in the university this year, so I'm searching work abilities. I've made this repository to show my coding skills to world, and let potential recruters to know what I can do right now.

Here are most interesting projects I made while studying in university. I really want to find a great job which will allow me to improve my professional skills.

As a student I learned Pascal, assembler, C (+ MPI, OpenMP), C++ (+ OpenGL), matlab (+ simulink). 

This info is for employer:

I was born in Kazakhstan in 1995, graduated from the special physics-mathematics school in Almaty in 2013 (https://almaty.fizmat.kz/en/).
Then I've graduated as a bachelor of Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU) in 2017 (https://www.msu.ru/en/) at the faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics (https://cs.msu.ru/en) at the department of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems and Control Processes (https://cs.msu.ru/en/departments/ndsipu). Now I'm going to graduate as a master at the same place.

My fields of interests: control engineering, nonlinear dynamics, robotics, delayed control, coding and many more (U can browse them here).

I've passed IELTS exam twice in 2012 and 2013 with average result grade 6.0 (Info from wikipedia: Competent User.	Has generally effective command of the language despite some inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings. Can use and understand fairly complex language, particularly in familiar situations.)
