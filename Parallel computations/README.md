I've been given a task to make solver for three dimension Cauchy problem for Laplace's equation with different types of boundary conditions.

Main requirement of this task were to make three solvers: straight (just a program), MPI realization (using MPI and 3d separation of a volume), MPI + OpenMP realization (just like second one but also using OpenMP to increase speed).
