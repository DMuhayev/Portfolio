We've (students) been given a task to make a ray tracer to a scene with a black hole with accretion disk.

Teacher provided us an initial solution project with ready for use classes, camera (almost) and scene.

Our task was: create a black hole on a stage, add a background texture, add there an accretion disk, add it's texture, place camera on right place, perform ray tracing with all physics laws (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)), render result.

Main problem of this project is that black hole must have so great mass that rays direction is affected by extreme gravity of the hole.
